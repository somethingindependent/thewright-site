        Over the years, we have come to see what 'real work' looks like and better understand the mindset that lies behind it â€“ a disposition inherent to the Mountain West and the independent-minded men and women who carve their paths here. Our purpose lies not in creating more ski makers, boat-builders, bike manufacturers or craft brewers or distillers, but rather to inspire the pursuit of the possible, to create more independent thinkers who exercise a moral imagination around the outdoors, who share a love of place and are drawn to lead a life rich with meaningful work.
