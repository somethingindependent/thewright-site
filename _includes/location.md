New for 2018, we're excited to be holding The Wright program in the heart of downtown Golden and on the campus of the Colorado School of Mines.

Golden is the the city "where the west lives" - at the cross section of the Old West, with its frontier heritage and community values, and the New West, driven by outdoor recreation and new technology.
