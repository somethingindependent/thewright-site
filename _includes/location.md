New for 2018, The Wright program and Award Night will move from Denver to the heart of downtown Golden, as well as to the campus of Colorado School of Mines. 

"Golden was founded over 150 years ago by entrepreneurs with adventurous spirits, and it continues to attract like-minded people today; from miners, brewers, ski and bike manufacturers, to scientists and engineers," says Golden Mayor Marjorie Sloan. "They share a sense of determination, a desire to innovate, and a love for the outdoors. The Wright represents all of these great things, and we are excited to host this unique summit and award program here in Golden, and to join in the discussions and celebrations for our community of outdoor-inspired innovators and entrepreneurs."
