  Hatched in 2011 as a non-traditional business award program, The Wright recognizes outdoor-inspired founders and companies. Businesses born not on the whiteboard but rather on the trail or around the campfire, perhaps even over a whiskey.

<h2> Real People | Real Work | Real Communities </h2>

<p class="centered-copy">
Each year, Something Independent embarks on a mission to assemble a new class of Wright contenders. The founders behind these companies draw inspiration from the outdoors and share a deep connection to the Rocky Mountain West. Not only do they make the things and design the stuff that help move us into and through the outdoors, but they bring their communities together by doing so. The commitment to their craft is evident. Their success comes earned.

The Wright is not an award you apply for. Contenders come via a nomination from their peers. Selected annually from over 100 nominees, each yearâ€™s class of is made up of a diverse collection of approximately 12 companies.
