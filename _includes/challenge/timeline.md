The Challenge will kick off with a live "reverse pitch" event at the Colorado School of Mines, our host campus, on January 12, 2019. Outdoor Industry companies and organizations representing each area of focus will provide participants with a chance to learn about the problem space and ask questions, as well as form teams, interact with participants from across the state, and get feedback on their problem solving approaches. The reverse pitches will also be streamed and recorded for virtual participants to access.

On January 30th, we will host a second reverse pitch & mentorship session at the Something Independent Trade School event, concurrent with the Outdoor Retailer + Snow Show event in Denver (Jan 30 - Feb 1, 2019). This will provide participants an opportunity to engage with the broader outdoor industry community and experience the energy and vibrancy of the industry first-hand at its largest single gathering.
