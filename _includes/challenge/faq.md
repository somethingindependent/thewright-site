## Who is welcome to participate?
Currently-enrolled students (undergraduate or graduate) from any participating institution are welcome to participate. Individual institutions may have additional qualifications - please check with your institution’s sponsors for additional details.

## What are the judging criteria?
The format will be a tournament-style pitch competition with two elimination rounds - one to determine finalists within each area of focus, and a second to determine an overall champion. Participants will be judged on the following criteria:

### INNOVATIVE THINKING AND PROBLEM-SOLVING
- How clearly have you articulated your understanding of the problem space?
- Have you put together a unique, realistic, actionable solution to present? 

### ECONOMIC VIABILITY
- Has the target beneficiary actually tried your solution?
- Is there tangible evidence the solution is on track (even initially) to solve their problem?
- Is your problem-solving approach well-reasoned and thorough?
- How well have you vetted your concept with potential partners and/or customers? Is it marketable?
- How well does your team bring to bear a variety of disciplines (e.g. engineering, business, policy) to arrive at a well-rounded solution?

### ECONOMIC & WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.
Many outdoor companies are based in communities close to where they can test product, outside of major urban areas. These communities are frequently looking for ways to increase their economic bases, provide training and education to improve the talent pool in their local workforces, and expand from seasonal to year-round economies. 
- Does your solution provide job creation and/or workforce development/training (this could encompass new business development)?   

### DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION
One of the industry’s greatest challenges is in ensuring that the recreational and economic opportunities it fosters are accessible to individuals encompassing a diverse set of backgrounds, abilities, and socioeconomic statuses.  
- Does your solution address these concerns?

## How do I get involved?
There are two steps:
- One, plan to attend one of our kickoff sessions in January. Though the
  sessions will be recorded for those who can't make it in person, the sessions
  are great opportunity to get briefed on the challenge areas, meet potential
  teammates, and connect with mentors. These sessions are open to students from
  any institution.
- Second, contact your campus coordinator for more details on the resources that
  your school has available to participants. These may include course credit,
  grant money, transportation, and more.
