New for 2019, The Wright Outdoor Innovation Challenge is a non-traditional collegiate innovation competition designed to bring together problem-solving minds from a variety of backgrounds (from engineering and hard sciences to economics, business, and policy) to address pressing needs within the outdoor recreation industry. Student teams will have the opportunity to learn about the unique challenges facing the industry in three challenge areas, engage with mentors with deep industry experience, and pitch their ideas in a tournament format for a shot at cash and prizes.

The goal of the Challenge is to catalyze innovative and entrepreneurial thinking in participating students, encouraging them to apply a problem-solving mindset beyond traditional disciplines. More broadly, we hope to establish foundational and authentic connections between Colorado higher-education institutions and the outdoor industry, creating inroads for future collaboration and career opportunities.

***The Challenge is not your typical award program or pitch competition. We’re looking for students who are passionate about real work in the outdoor industry, and committed to developing practical, innovative solutions to real-world problems with an entrepreneur’s eye.***

Our 2019 areas of focus are:

### SUSTAINABILITY, CONSERVATION & STEWARDSHIP
The outdoor industry is taking a lead role in discussions on transitioning economies, sustainable community development and environmental stewardship by driving a more robust discussion around systemic sustainability challenges and holistic product design.

### INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES & MATERIALS
Manufacturers and gear producers are constantly searching for new technologies, materials, and manufacturing techniques that can increase performance, decrease cost, and unlock new possibilities for outdoor recreation.

### ACCESSIBILITY, HEALTH & WELLNESS
Address social determinants of health by increasing outdoor recreation opportunities for people of all backgrounds and abilities. And/or assist in quantifying impacts of access to outdoor recreation and related social determinants on healthcare outcomes and costs.
