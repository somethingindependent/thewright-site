We’ve worked hard to bring high-level, inspirational talks and tactical workshops with hard-skill takeaways to you at no cost. All afternoon sessions ­ keynote speakers, panel discussions, workshops ­ are **FREE and open-to-the-public**. This unique opportunity is made possible through the generous support of our partners and, new this year, our patrons. All we ask is that you register in advance.

Join us to celebrate this year’s contenders and crown the one ultimate winner of the 2018 Wright Award! Award Night at The Wright redefines the business award program as we know it. Experience the energy, inspiration and entrepreneurial spirit of Award Night for yourself. We offer three ways to attend and support - buy an individual ticket, show your support for the Rocky Mountain mindset with a Wright Patron Pass, or become a partner. We can do the work of The Wright only in partnership with individuals like you and organizations like yours.
