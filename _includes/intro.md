The Wright recognizes the doers. Outdoor-inspired founders. Their companies are hatched not on the whiteboard but on the trail or around the campfire, perhaps over a whiskey. They are that unique breed of leader. The kind to bet on instinct over conventional wisdom. Principled and courageous. Committed to a purpose beyond the bottom line. The first-to-the-barnraising type. You know them.
