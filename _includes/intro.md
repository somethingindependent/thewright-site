The Wright celebrates a unique breed of leader. The kind to bet on instinct over conventional wisdom. Inspired by hard working, independent-minded men and women of the Rocky Mountain Region, The Wright brings 3 days of discussions, workshops, keynotes and events all culminating in the high-energy, much-anticipated Award Night program to Golden, Colorado – “Where the West Lives” - from May 1st-3rd.
