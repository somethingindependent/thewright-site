Ahead of the main event, join us at the Product Gallery to get a first look at the contenders vying for the 2018 prize. Get to know their founders, hear their stories and explore their project with hands-on demos.

The culminating event of The Wright, the award program features the first-time public screening of 90-second videos produced and submitted by each of the contenders. As part of their selection, each company is charged with conveying their vision, their mission and their inspiration. The debut of the contender videos is followed by the announcement of three finalists who take the stage together and face a rapid-fire Q&A session from a panel of judges. The judges, in turn, are tasked with selecting the winner and presenting the $5,000 prize. For 2018, Award Night is being hosted in partnership with Colorado School of Mines at Lockridge Arena.
