A 'campfire' conversation with trusted industry veterans discussing the outdoor industry’s move from the proverbial kids table to an invitation to sit with the impactful economic adults. The outdoor industry was recently recognized as an economic powerhouse valued in 2017 as adding $887 billion each year to the U.S. economy. However, what has been the cost? Is professionalism and competition as rewarding as carving your own path in adventure that didn’t yet exist. How does adult-fun compare and contrast to juvenile-fun? And what are the responsibilities that come with the way we now conduct ourselves. As an industry in transition, we’ll look back for perspective on our future legacy.
