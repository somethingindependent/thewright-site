Do you believe/trust the data you have? Do you act on the insights discovered within the data? What is done when an insight doesn’t jive with your brand narrative? This 90-minute workshop focuses on the intersection of technology, data insight and customer journey visualization. Empower your organization to build an enriching experience for each customer by employing 6 metrics to simplify your data’s complexity and to better understand the significance of what your customer is really ‘telling’ you.
