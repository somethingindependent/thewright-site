Do you believe/trust the data you have? Do you act on the insights discovered within the data? What do you do if an insight doesn’t jive with your brand narrative? This 90-minute workshop focuses on the intersection of technology, data insight and customer journey visualization. Empower your organization to build an enriching experience for each customer by distilling value with 6 simple metrics to simplify your data’s complexity and to better understand the significance of what your customer is really ‘telling’ you.
