Justin Reiter is an Olympic Snowboarder, Olympic gold-medal coach and adventurer of all types, based in Steamboat Springs Colorado. He has been on the US Snowboard Team for 10 years, is a 10x National Champion, World Cup Champion, and took the Silver Medal at the Snowboard World Championships. As an angler, biker, hiker, scrambler and snowboard mountaineer, he's a lifestyle athlete in true form, focused on inspiring young athletes. Justin was the first person to ride his bike down all 16 of Coloradoâ€™s legal 14ers.  Justin is passionate about the environment, growth, and always down to venture outside.
