A multi-disciplinary exhibition set against the backdrop of North America’s largest gathering of outdoor industry leaders, Trade School explores the mindset of the ‘doer' – artist & engineer, entrepreneur & first-responder, athlete & advocate – offering a window into the work that we undertake, the differences we seek to make and the challenges we face. Through art installation, discussion and live-audience podcasts, Trade School will delve into the very nature of work. For the outdoor-inspired, a deep connection to personal identity is realized through work. The work that keeps one up at night and gets one out of bed before first light. In the marrying of vocation and avocation, work is relevant first and foremost to oneself. In the give-and-take between independence and interdependence, a multitude of tensions and possibilities exist. And when a balance can be struck between the two, a collaborative portrait of work emerges.”

# About Understudy – Art for Everyone
Understudy is Denver’s first-of-its-kind arts and culture incubator and experimental space. Operated, curated and funded by the Denver Theatre District, Understudy is a 700-square-foot space for the community to explore and experience new artistic and cultural endeavors. Understudy is a way to experiment both operationally and artistically, to determine the best way to provide artists, creative groups and the community with a free, central, immersive and innovative space for installation-based work.

# About Something Independent
Over the years, we have come to see what 'real work' looks like and better understand the mindset that lies behind it – a disposition inherent to the Mountain West and the independent-minded men and women who carve their paths here. Starting with the inaugural SIA SnowShow in Denver in early 2010, Something Independent set out to promote the industry and culture of snowsports in Colorado. Programs including the Economics of Soul, the Art of Winter and the Entrepreneurs Garage highlighted the industry’s outsized impact on communities and economies across the state. Today, initiatives such as The Wright, S|I OutPost and Trade School provide means through which to explore the challenges and possibilities that bring us closer to the core of meaningful work.”
