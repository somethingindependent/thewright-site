First Descents provides life-changing, outdoor adventures for young adults impacted by cancer, improving long-term survivorship through outdoor experiential programming. Their challenge is to devise tools and strategies for better gathering data and reporting outcomes around social determinants of health, in order to better make the case that doctors and insurers should prescribe and reimburse for adventure as a first-class citizen in a patient's treatment program.
