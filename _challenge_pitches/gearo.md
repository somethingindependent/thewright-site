Gearo is on a mission to simplify the rental gear discovery and booking process,
equipping retailers with the management tools they need to grow and thrive,
while providing gear-seekers with a convenient, consolidated view of bookable
online rentals. Their challenge is around the launch strategy for their
marketplace, and how best to get the word out to partners and customers as they
move towards a public launch.
