As leaders it is our responsibility to bring developing talent into the fold. They are the future leaders of our industries and they are smart, full of purpose, innovative and tech savvy. So, how do we help? It all starts with an honest one-on-one conversation between a current and emerging leader. From there the organization and leadership team needs to determine how to create the space, opportunity and platform that encourages active face-to-face connection and peer support. Over time a shared reality is created and an internal culture develops that is more likely to keep our valued-talent and emerging-leaders loyal. Letâ€™s talk about how different sized companies are making it happen. \[Pro Tip: it is more than ping pong tables and free beer\]
