Coinciding with “Our Home,” Jen Gurecki of Coalition Snow and Amanda Goad of BoldBrew will be recording a “Tools of the Trade” live session of Coalition Snow’s new podcast, Juicy Bits, at Something Independent’s new Trade School where they’ll be diving deeper into Audre Lorde’s quote, “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house,” and the state of women in the outdoor industry and beyond.
