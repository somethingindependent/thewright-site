Rural communities have been suffering over the last several decades, and the outdoor recreation economy can be a primary driver for recruitment of new businesses and job creation for these decimated communities. Many of these communities have unsurpassed natural assets from mountains, rivers, and thousands of acres of public lands open for recreation. Rural communities have the opportunity to rebrand their communities to celebrate the outdoor recreation assets to recruit businesses to relocate and provide jobs. Rural communities in the west provide a companyâ€™s dream place to live, work, and play without being overcrowded and expensive. Rural America can capitalize on the quality of life it provides.
