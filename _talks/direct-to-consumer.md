When you have a relationship with the customer there is inherent insight into their lives, behaviors and what’s important to them. Resultantly, more and more brands are establishing direct-to-consumer models, so what does the future hold for the role of the retailer? We’ll spend 75 minutes getting multiple views of the retail ecosystem (brick & mortar, eCommerce, affiliates & reps, made-to-order, merchandising).
